Le't start with my guiding principle.
The hardest won skill in coding is confidence.
You must make meaningful steps to gaining that confidence.
The only way to gain confidence in javascript is to solve problems in javascript.

For the beginner I suggest freecodecamp.org and their JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification.
This course will probably take you two months if you put in 8-10 hours a week. It is worth every second.
This will slowly introduce you to the core concepts of the language, and once you reach the end you'll be more confident in your coding skills. It will challenge you, but not to the point of crushing frustration.

To help you on your journey there, I recommend: MDN docs, javascript.info, and also watching youtube videos on very specific subjects. One great Udemy course is Modern Javascript by Colt Steele, you can jump to videos on particular subjects and get a quick and thourough overview. 

Once you're that far, it's time to start looking at the bigger picture and how to actually build apps from vanilla js.
That when you take practical javascript. A free, and high quality course that walks you through the process of creating a todo app. You'll review basics.
I took this course twice, and on the second round I built a flash card app alongside the teacher to practice applying the skills.

By the time you reach the end of that, with a small project in your hand, it's only 3 months later and you'll be ready to tackle whatever concepts interest you.
